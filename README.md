# Jekyll Boom! Starter Theme V2

A more "advanced" starter theme for books, see the 
[Jekyll Boom! Starter Theme V1](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-boom-theme) for
a more "basic" HTML-only version.
The V2 includes:

1) Uses plain text in Markdown for all chapters, preface, table of contents, index, etc.

For example the preface in the "basic" HTML version:

```html
<p>This is a sample document whose purpose is to show how CSS can be
used to print a book. To make the document more lively, excerpts from
the third edition of &ldquo;Cascading Style Sheets &mdash; designing
for tbe Web&rdquo; have been included.<span class="footnote"> That
book <em>was</em> produced using the methods described in the
document, and it was published by Addison-Wesley in 2005.</span> The
excerpts have been selected for their example values and they appear,
in this document, out of order.</p>

<p>The PDF version of this document is produced directly from the HTML
and CSS sources by the Prince formatter.</p>
```

becomes in Markdown:

```markdown

used to print a book. To make the document more lively, excerpts from
the third edition of "Cascading Style Sheets - designing
for the Web" have been included.[^1] The

2) "Simplified" and "cleaned up" styles and markup to work along with the Markdown conventions and best practices
